This is an example app to learn about different ways to implement
Logins in Rails.  See [Rails Authentication](https://backend-development.github.io/rails_authentication.html)
in backend-development.github.io.

This repository contains 4 branches with 4 different implementations.
See the demo apps to get an overview:

* [Demo with No Login](https://kanban-1.herokuapp.com/) the basic app with no login
* [Demo with Basic Authentication](https://kanban-2.herokuapp.com/) using only built in Rails 5 features
* [Demo with Devise](https://kanban-3.herokuapp.com/) gives you password reminders, confirmation, and so on
* [Demo with Omniauth](https://kanban-4.herokuapp.com/) enables login with Google, Facebook and many other providers


The example app implements a simple kanban board, and looks like this:
